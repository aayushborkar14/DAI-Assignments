61,105823,2016-07-08,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"This has to do with Santander Bank. My wife closed our account on XXXX/XXXX/16 and was given no written documentation or verbal conditions of closing the account. On XXXX/XXXX/16 we received a phone call after XXXX from the XXXX XXXX Santander Branch in XXXX, PA saying that our account was overdrawn due to XXXX transactions, XXXX of which were dated XXXX/XXXX/16 and the XXXX others dated XXXX/XXXX/16. I went immediately the next day on XXXX/XXXX/16 in good faith to pay the {$67.00} that I owed them for the XXXX transactions by paypal and asked how these transactions could go through 2 days and 5 days after an account was closed with a {$0.00} and negative balance. I was told that if transactions are made before the account was closed within 24-48 hours the account will reopen and transactions will continue even with a negative balance. They could not provide any written policy when asked. I paid the {$67.00} for the XXXX charges and asked them to dispute the {$140.00} in overdraft charges. At the same time they had informed me that the savings account was n't properly closed because there was still {$0.00} left in the account so I am not even sure the Branch closed the account properly and just did a withdrawal versus closing. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I received a call from XXXX at the Santander Bank collections department trying to collect the {$140.00} and I told them the account was being disputed and she did n't even realize the account was closed making me more skeptical if the account was closed. She then forwarded me to XXXX at the customer service department. After explaining my situation he kept me on hold several times for 30 minutes saying they were speaking about it and said they could n't help me and I have to go back to the branch. I asked for the supervisors name and he said the calls are recorded if I was going to file a complaint. I asked him to forward me to his supervisor which he did.She then told me that the bank will allow transactions up to 30 days on closed accounts not the 24-48 hours the branch told me. When I asked if they had a written policy she admitted they did n't. At this point it seems like the bank is acting recklessly with no written policy on how to handle closed accounts and how long they accept charges. As recommended by customer service I contacted the XXXX XXXX branch in XXXX, PA on XXXX/XXXX/16 hoping to speak the branch manager. I spoke to XXXX who told me that the branch manager was n't available today or on Saturday and I could try back next week if I wanted to. She told me he told her to tell me to contact customer service. When I told them I spoke to customer service and they told me to contact the branch manager she told me that is what he told me and I can try back next week if I wanted to. At this point I told XXXX that no one can give me a straight answer and told her I was contacting the Consumer Finance Bureau she said go ahead and hung up. I called back trying to speak to XXXX who I spoke to on XXXX/XXXX/2016 at XXXX and was told she was with a customer and she never called me back. I feel that the bank is taking advantage of us and trying to corner us into paying the overdraft fees by sending me to branch to customer service and back and forth in a wild goose chase. I think the bank is acting recklessly and committing fraud by closing accounts and accepting debits on the accounts with {$0.00} or negative balances to collect overdraft fees and not notifying the account holder until a week later. I work for a bank and have spoken to a former Santander Branch Manager, a lender at the bank, a branch manager at my bank and they have all agreed that they are not right and not acting in good faith and should return our fees after I already paid the debited amounts in full. I am hoping by contacting this bureau to get my overdraft fees reversed and to notify any other customers who have been taking advantage of with no written policy.

65,118191,2015-11-12,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"This complaint is about the fees my bank charged for a wire transfer, not the transfer itself. I did some business with a company XXXX and they pay through wire transfer. I had the money wired to my SunTrust account. The remitting bank XXXX provided a receipt showing that they remitted {$9100.00} XXXX to SunTrust. When I received the deposit, {$30.00} XXXX was missing, but then SunTrust charged me {$15.00} separately for a "" domestic '' wire transfer. SunTrust publishes an incoming international wire transfer fee of {$30.00}. When I questioned the double charge XXXX {$30.00} off the top and {$15.00} extra ), SunTrust said they did not charge the {$30.00}. After several emails and phone calls, someone looked at the trail and determined that the incoming wire transfer came through XXXX bank and SunTrust received {$9100.00}. My guess is that SunTrust uses XXXX to process their international wire transfers since they are not an international bank. The Swift code for SunTrust was used but it obviously went through XXXX first, which shaved the published {$30.00} fee off the transaction. My main concern is that in the process of receiving my money, {$30.00} disappeared and I have no receipt or explanation for it. The fact that I was charged {$15.00} for a "" domestic '' wire transfer between the bank SunTrust uses for international transfers and SunTrust itself is double-dipping and criminal. These transactions should be transparent and all fees should be disclosed up front. I would have been fine giving SunTrust the published {$30.00} for the international wire transfer, but the fact that another bank ( that I am not a customer of ) got that and then I was charged {$15.00} for a domestic transfer is the issue. It 's dishonest and needs to be stopped.

131,53239,2015-05-29,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"I formerly used Bank of the West in California for all my financial needs. On XXXX/XXXX/15 this financial institution forcefully closed my joint account without my authorization using funds from XXXX of my individual accounts to cover the overdrawn balance ( {$300.00} ). I was never contacted by this institution to inform me of the transfer of funds or the forced closure of the joint account. I would have covered the overdraft if I had known about it. The joint account was shared by myself and my wife, I only used it to transfer funds when she needed it. Since the account was operated and maintained by my wife, I was unaware of the negative balance. I contacted this institutions telephone customer service before XXXX/XXXX/15 to ask if the funds were wrongfully transferred and if the account was in fact closed. They informed me that it was in fact forceably closed. I than asked for copies of any and all disclosures which I may have signed on the account and or more particularly, the XXXX which releases the need for my personal authorization to transfer funds between account I hold. The representative than sounded confused and informed me that this financial institution does not need my approval to cover negative balances on accounts and that there are no disclosures associated with this account which they could provide me with. I know for a fact that there must at least be the disclosures I signed to open the account. I than asked to speak to a supervisor at which time, the representative informed me that the call center had already closed and she was the only person left in the building. I requested to see if some of the fees for this account which were well over XXXX percent of the overdue balance could be waived or partially waived to relieve some of the hardship which seemed so wrongfully poised in my position. I was instructed to talk to the branch which holds ownership of my accounts. This branch is in XXXX XXXX, CA. It is XXXX miles from my account. I requested long ago to have my accounts transfered to XXXX XXXX, CA. I was informed that the ownership of my account was not able to be changed and that I should close the accounts I had previously opened in XXXX XXXX, CA and than open new accounts with the branch in XXXX XXXX, CA. I declined to close these accounts since I did not see a need to burden myself with changing all of my finances to reflect the new account numbers. 

On XXXX/XXXX/15 I entered this financial institution 's branch in XXXX, CA on XXXX XXXX to close my remaining Individual Checking Account and move on to another financial institution. When my turn in line came, I told the teller at the window that I would like to close my account. The teller handed me {$1200.00}. I asked him if the account was now closed. He confirmed closure of the account. 

Today, XXXX/XXXX/15 I received an overdraft notification from this institution for the account which they had confirmed to have closed on XXXX/XXXX/15. I contacted customer service. I requested to speak to a supervisor. Once online, I started from the beginning informing her of the joint accounts forced closure. She reiterated that the institution does not require a signed disclosure to transfer personal funds. I asked for copies of the disclosures on my account. None have been provided. The supervisor once again told me that nothing can be reversed from within the call center and I would have to return to the branch. I talked to her about the individual accounts closure. She told me that there is no papertrail proving my intent to close the account. I have since incurred an autodebit and monthly service charge which have forced the account into the negative, an account which should have been closed. 

I feel that this institution has wronged me. I feel that they are in the business to collect fees solely. I feel that they do not care. I am being wronged for a XXXX time with no help.

135,80031,2015-10-22,Bank account or service,Checking account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"On Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2015, I realized that a deposit I previously made of {$18000.00} at Regions in XXXX XXXX, Florida never made it into my account. I phoned Regions and informed them of the missing funds. I spoke with XXXX. She too, said the monies were not in my account. She assured me she would research it and get back to me. She never did. I decided to drive over to the branch where I made the deposit with my deposit slip in hand. I met with a woman named XXXX XXXX who was unable to locate the monies in my account but researched while I was there but was unable to find anything. She made a copy of my deposit slip and told me they were going to research it and get back to me. Later that day, I received a call from XXXX XXXX informing me that they are coming up empty. XXXX, the branch supervisor got on the phone and explained that the deposit was reversed but she does not know why. In, what we now know, is the typical Regions fashion, they just pass the buck. XXXX said that on Monday the regional manager was going to take over and investigate the missing funds. In the meantime, my husband phoned Regions once on Friday the XXXX and twice on Saturday the XXXX. Both times he was assured someone would research it and return our call. Neither of the XXXX returned his call. He did however discover on his call that the teller that took my checks for deposit and provided me the deposit slip has since been terminated. At around XXXX on Monday the XXXX, I phoned XXXX XXXX to see where they were in the investigation. She informed me that they were no longer in a position to provide me any further information. Stunned, I demanded the name and number of the Regional Manager who was taking over the investigation. After being on hold for XXXX minutes, XXXX XXXX came back with the name XXXX XXXX and his cell phone number. At about XXXX on Monday the XXXX, I phoned XXXX. At that point, XXXX was not even aware of my missing funds. He told me he would research it and get back to me. XXXX did in fact get back to me and informed me that they needed more time and can not seem to locate my missing funds. That was the first and only time anyone at Regions has EVER returned my call. On Monday the XXXX, my husband also called XXXX.Regions and spoke with a woman named XXXX. She swore she would call us back after she investigated it. She never did. What she did tell us, however, is that no complaint was filed on Friday when I made the original complaint about the missing funds. She assured us she was taking care of the complaint.On Tuesday, I phoned Regions to determine what was going on with my monies. Again, I was told that they would research it and get back to me. Nothing. I also phoned XXXX to see the status. He informed me that he has no information for me and I should speak to his boss, XXXX XXXX, City President. I of course phoned XXXX immediately and left him a voicemail. My husband and I both noted our dissatisfaction with Regions through social media.We received a call from Regions and again promising they would get back to us. They did not. Today, XXXX XXXX, I receive a call from XXXX assistant. She informed me that XXXX was researching it and would have an answer for me by the end of the day. Of course no call was ever made. I phoned and left a message. No Response. So I yet again call Regions. I spoke with a supervisor named XXXX XXXX. XXXX also tells me she is shocked that no complaint was filed when I spoke with XXXX on Friday the XXXX. She informed me that no complaint was filed on Monday either when we spoke with XXXX, but not filed until late XXXX night. She claims she filed a Credit Request. We shall see. XXXX XXXX today said she will call tomorrow. We need help. Too much time is passing and we are very concerned that monies were stolen and they are trying to cover.

However, they never did close my account and allowed several other transactions to post. Yesterday, XXXX XXXX, 2015 XXXX transactions posted, totaling {$48.00}. In order to avoid the overdraft fees, I deposited a check from the bank I am currently using into my account on the same day. However, as they do, they still charged me XXXX {$34.00} fees. Now I owe them {$64.00} in overdraft fees for {$48.00} transactions. I have contacted them asking them to refund the fees, but they will not. Nor will they close my account. The fees are not valid because first of all, my account should have been closed, and second of all, I deposited funds into the account on the same business day to prevent the overdraft.

THE PICTURES THAT CHASE WERE SENT FROM XXXX ( proving service delivery ) ARE OF XXXX. THEY DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS REBUTTAL. THAT IS NOT THE SERVICES I am disputing. I Worked as a XXXX with XXXX in a SEPARATE ISSUE. XXXX sent CHASE BANK FRAUDULENT PICTURES from a completely SEPARATE ISSUE IN ORDER TO GET THE FUNDS BACK AND I PROVED THIS TO CHASE. 

I DEPOSITED A CHECK FOR {$3500.00} INTO MY BANK ACCOUNT IN XXXX XXXX FROM MY CLIENTS XXXX AND XXXX OF XXXX WITH THIER MANAGER XXXX XXXX PRESENT. OUT OF THE {$3500.00} I PAID A THIRD PARTY XXXX XXXX XXXX {$2000.00} TO DELIVER SERVICES TO MY CLIENTS FOR XXXX. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX WAS SUPPOSE TO DELIVER SERVICES THAT WOULD HAVE AMOUNTED TO {$2000.00} which entailed XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, AND AN XXXX 60 DAYS. 

THE OTHER {$1500.00} WAS KEPT BY XXXX XXXX. Client XXXX and XXXX from XXXX wrote XXXX a check for {$3500.00} deposited into XXXX XXXX account at Chase. {$2000.00} went to XXXX for a WRITE UP in XXXX XXXX and for the clients music to go on XXXX, XXXX and XXXX across the nation. My client had just recorded a song with XXXX XXXX. 

THE CLIENT XXXX XXXX WAS A CLIENT OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX CASHED THE CHECK OF {$3500.00} IN HER CHASE ACCOUNT AND GAVE XXXX A XXXX PAYMENT OF {$2000.00}. XXXX NEVER DELIVERED THE SERVICES AND THE CLIENT XXXX ASKED FOR A REFUND FROM XXXX AND FROM XXXX FOR NON RECEIPT OF SERVICES. XXXX AGREED TO GIVE A REFUND To the client since 60 days had passed and no services were given. XXXX promised the client to return the entired {$3500.00} by the end of XXXX XXXX in WRITING via email. XXXX never gave the refund so the client asked me to take back the {$2000.00} I put in a claim with Chase. Chase is the most unprofessional dishonorable bank I have ever dealt with. This has been a nightmare. 

XXXX submitted fraudalent paper work to the bank/pictures from a completeley seperate transaction as PROOF for this transaction! I proved to chase that what she submitted was a lie as you will see in the following uploads. 

SINCE THEN XXXX HAS GOTTEN BACK {$2000.00} FROM XXXX CHASE ACCOUNT. In addition she SENT THE CLIENT A BOUNCED CHECK FROM A XXXX XXXX ACCOUNT. She robbed me and my clients completley. 

Chase Bank allowed XXXX to send them EMAILES, TEXT MESSAGES AND XXXX. WHEN I SUBMITTED MY DOCUMENTATION Which was much more comprehensive with proof and letters and front and back of checks along with XXXX stating she would give back the funds, THE BANK REFUSED them and told me I ca n't send emails and text messages! ( mind you they allowed her to send hers ) You will see docs for what I mean. They did an "" I can, You ca n't '' behavior model. 

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT XXXX AND XXXX FOR PROOF THAT XXXX DID NOT GIVE THE SERVICES. ALL DOCUMENTATION XXXX SENT TO YOU IS FRAUDULENT.

The purpose of our visit was to add my fiance 's name to my account that I hold with Wells Fargo as sole owner. After waiting more than half an hour XXXX XXXX who claimed to be store manager invited us to her office. After explaining her very clear what we wanted she told us with an accent that she could not just add the name into my account because I am a foreigner and insisted to add my fiance 's name as primary owner of account and me as secondary because she has SSN and I did not, and all responsibility would be on her name and SSN. After feeling confused and discriminated by XXXX XXXX XXXX about my status in United States and having no help as to what is right or wrong to do we agreed to do it her way. So we signed some documents from which we never got official customer copy as every Wells Fargo branch does and were assured that everything is ok and were prompted to go. On Thursday the XXXX of XXXX I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX XXXX and the purpose of calling was that in the banks system there was some error about our recent request. So she insisted again with accent that me and my wife went back to XXXX XXXX branch to sort out her mistake. I refused to go back and told XXXX XXXX that I will go to a branch near my location to find out what is the problem. On Saturday the XXXX of XXXX me and my wife visited Wells Fargo branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX welcomed us and invited us to his office. After explaining our situation to XXXX XXXX he was amazed that a store manager did such a mistake. By saying mistake I mean that she created mess with my account as a sole owner and added my wife as primary, something she was never supposed to do because she could just add her name under mine. We discussed our options with XXXX XXXX as to what to do because we did not want to keep my wife 's name as primary account holder. So we asked XXXX XXXX to change the relationship on my account and delete my wife 's name and so he did. He also gave us official customer copy with his actions. We believed everything was good until I made a transfer from my original account. Then my wife called me and told me that in her account it seems like she did the transfer because her name comes up as owner of account. Next day i visited the previous mentioned branch in XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX assisted me and invited me to her office. I explained her in detail what has happened and she tried again to remove my wife 's name from my account but she could not. Then she asked XXXX her co workers on bank for help so these XXXX men offered to .After long waiting for an answer they told me that they can not delete my wife 's name because system does not let them. Then XXXX XXXX entered the branch and I asked XXXX and these XXXX men to transfer to him my issue because he was the one who assisted us last time. XXXX XXXX was not on duty but offered to help. After some time XXXX XXXX came and informed me that the relationship change he did was successful and my wife 's name was deleted but then some banker went online and changed that relationship again and made my wife 's name again primary owner. XXXX after looking on the system informed me that the this action was taken by XXXX XXXX XXXX. Being totally confused and violated from what I heard I asked why XXXX XXXX did what she did and with what authorization. As the bankers told me she went online and changed again relationship for my account by using our signatures from the XXXX of XXXX and created fake document. She misled us first when we went to XXXX XXXX branch so it looks like my wife opened new account and then when we corrected her mistake she went online again without any authorization!

Of course - they are the BANK so they are always right. I am only the customer confused by the inundation of unwanted offers and e-mails from the BANK. 
So decided to try an offer - a balance transfer from XXXX XXXX. I wanted to transfer {$200.00} using their "" no transfer fee '' offer. Apparently I used the wrong check and was charged {$10.00} on a {$200.00} transfer. Usurous. That is an instant 5 % penalty. They were VERY unsympathetic. They got my {$10.00} for that tiny transfer! High fives!!! 
When I contacted the BANK and told them I intended to use a different offer, they were VERY unsympathetic and just told me they could n't do anything. We all know they could - so not only are they customer unfriendly but they are liars. They got my {$10.00} and to XXXX with what I wanted. They also misclassified the transfer as dept store/ retail - not a balance transfer from another card. 
But they are the BANK and always right. Note the unsympathetic response. 
Here is the classification they claim is correct : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX BALANCE TRANSFER - FNBO Retail/Department Stores {$200.00} XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX BAL TRAN FEE - XXXX Retail/Department Stores {$10.00} This was a transfer from XXXX XXXX business cards so we can clearly see that the BANK did everything correctly. The classification of the transfer is my fault. Somehow. 
How do my balances increase when I have n't made any charges - I 'll include on example, there are others. 
Charge Summary XXXX 2015 Purchases 13.99 % ( v ) {$670.00} XXXX {$7.00} XX/XX/XXXX PR Special 9.99 % ( v ) {$620.00} XXXX {$5.00} XX/XX/XXXX BT Special 5.99 % ( f ) {$490.00} XXXX {$2.00} Charge Summary XXXX 2015 Purchases 13.99 % ( v ) {$670.00} XXXX {$7.00} XX/XX/XXXX PR Special 9.99 % ( v ) {$620.00} XXXX {$5.00} XX/XX/XXXX BT Special 5.99 % ( f ) {$550.00} XXXX {$2.00} How did the balance increase from {$620.00} to {$620.00} when I had made NO charges.

199,57344,2015-08-27,Bank account or service,Checking account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015 my XXXX email was apparently hacked into because I started getting emails on my phone approximately every XXXX seconds. Many of the emails were in languages I do n't understand such as XXXX, XXXX, etc. I did not open any of the emails because I knew something was wrong, and instead I stopped using the email because it was so old I figured the best thing to do was to start a new XXXX email, and I did. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015 and unbeknownst to me, a new Checking and Savings account was opened up in my name at my financial institution, USAA Bank located in XXXX XXXX, TX. 
Also unbeknownst to me, and on this same date the culprits did an electronic transfer into this new checking account in the amount of {$2000.00} and electronic transfer into new savings account in the amount of {$1900.00}. Then on this same date the funds were transferred out/withdrawn. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015 at approximately XXXX I attempted to place a phone order for food delivery and was told my card was being declined. I then checked my account online to find that my original accounts ( checking & savings ) with USAA had XXXX balances. Last I checked these account balances it was {$530.00} in checking and {$80.00} in savings. The next morning XXXX/XXXX/15 I called USAA to find out what was going on with my accounts that I had zero balances. That 's when I was informed of the above mentioned transfers in and out of my accounts. However, the representative did not mention that this activity was done in the new accounts that someone had set up in my name~ so I was under the impression that she was referring to activity that took place within my original accounts. Nonetheless, I informed her that I made no such deposits for said amounts on said day ( XXXX ). The representative said a fraud investigation would have to be opened on my accounts and to give them a few days to contact me. 
On XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX I called USAA for the status and was told that the investigation had been completed and that I was being held responsible for the negative account balance. 
On XXXX I called USAA back to get more information on how they determined me to be guilty of fraudulent activity within my account. They said that I did an electronic transfer from a credit union account with my name on it, back and forth to the USAA account. I told them without a doubt that I do n't have a credit union account or any other bank accounts other than USAA. They would not tell me the name of said "" credit union '' or the location, but gave me the routing number and account number. I then went to my local police station and filed a report. Also called the local FBI office who looked up the routing number for "" credit union '' account and informed me that this was not a credit union account but an account at a XXXX XXXX bank in XXXX, MN. 
I went to a XXXX XXXX bank near my home with the information I was given and they determined that the routing and account number was the legitimate account of one of their customers, who is not me. XXXX XXXX confirmed the account belonged to a gentleman in Minnesota, I was not given his name as that information is private. 
In closing, I want USAA to reimburse me for funds they confiscated from me in connection with my identity being used for money stolen from the bank. The amount USAA took from me to put towards negative balance is {$610.00} ( {$530.00} from checking & {$80.00} from savings ). 
In short, USAA got robbed by hackers and in the process I was used by way of identity theft, but USAA want to make me pay for something that I did not do. 
On XXXX/XXXX/15 I relayed the aforementioned info to USAA and they said I 'm still responsible. 
How is that so? XXXX XXXX can confirm that I am not a customer with them and have no accounts with their bank.

I am filing a complaint because they are concrete in their explanation and it does not make sense to have a very much reduced balance that is not considered to have sufficed for the XXXX XXXX, 2016 payment. I called today to ask for a breakdown of how my payments have been used to pay against the balance. They stated they had to mail it to me because it is not their policy to email or fax that information. This will cause more interest to accrue against me. I do not mind paying the payment, however by the end of the month the GAP claim should provide the remaining balance to be paid and I am concerned that if I over pay, I may not get a refund in a timely manner or in the amount that would actually be due back to me.

249,87322,2015-10-07,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"My husband and I purchased a car through a local XXXX dealership approximately XXXX XXXX years ago. We obtained financing through the dealership who elected PNC Bank to finance the transaction. At the time we had no objections ( and still do not with the terms/structure of the loan ). However, PNC 's policy, which was described by their representative as industry standard, is to automatically enroll borrowers in paperless billing for revolving loans. I 'm a millennial and have no issue with paperless accounts ; however, PNC bank has made it virtually impossible to gain access to the online account because:1 ) PNC Bank 's online banking system does not recognize car loan account information ( and the online account information was never mailed to my home ). 
2 ) The customer help line resulted in an hour and a half of cumulative wait periods. 
3 ) The only online help is available via XXXX. That 's right. XXXX twitter. 

Again, I 'm a millennial and am disgusted by the notion that I 'm subjected to 1.5 hours waiting online for customer assistance or the use of XXXX ( which by the way I tried this platform and could not be assisted via this platform ) simply to gain access to my loan information which should be provided, either via email or printed, to consumers, unless the borrower specifically opts into such a program to limit receipt of their statements. 

It is noteworthy, 2 months later my husband and I got another car, this time with financing provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX and I was NOT enrolled automatically in online statements. I have received a letter in the mail every month with my account information. 

Having access, regardless of being a revolving account, is critical for consumers to manage their accounts, debts, repayment plans, etc. For our account, we have been doubling our car payment and I truthfully, have no idea how much we owe on his loan. I was able to find out the information back in XXXX when I contacted PNC bank, but have subsequently misplaced my log-in information and have not been able to gain access to my accounts since. ( I asked at the time during the call for paper statements but was advised she could not make the change, I had to apply for the change via my online account ). 

Making it this difficult to gain access to loan statements is a significant disadvantage to the consumers. 

Thank you CFPB for your help.

I have tried really hard to keep notes of all of the mess, but I may have missed some names and dates when I was n't near my notepaid, or laid up in bed. My husband had to get a job that takes him over XXXX miles away from home and is gone 8 months of the year now, after being made to quit his job of 35 years, because if he quit they would n't have to pay him his retirement plan. I have tried to work with Bank of America ( BOA ) since XXXX, I made a call after talking to our bank about them taking it over. She advised me to call BOA as banks will always negotiate an interest especially she said for loyal customers that always have made their payments. I was told in XXXX our unit was then under water and it was against the law for them to loan on it so there was nothing they could do. I continued to call ever 2 years, always to be told a different story. In XXXX we began to have problems with them as we had them on auto pay every month for our unit, and our XXXX XXXX. They had taken XXXX payments out of our XXXX account and we overdrafted. I called and was told they could n't put the money back in our account they would have write a check. We bought XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, special order for Alaskan Temps. We have never missed a payment to BOA. On the advise of my sister who was a XXXX XXXX for XXXX she said to miss a payment so they would work with me. The nightmare began, There are to many names to list, the highlight is this, XXXX XXXX called our home at XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, we spoke at length The only thing BOA could do to help us out was to give us a 2 month extenstion at the end of our loan. I told that still was n't going to help but we would keep going until we could n't. He asked if I would make the XXXX payment by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I told him I would scrap every dime we had as we did n't and could n't afford to lose it as my husband has to live in it instead of retire in it! I then had to go to our ER, and was told I was suffering, XXXX XXXX, it was becoming to much. I went on to BOA 'S website to make our payment on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, it wouldnt take our payment. I then spent the next 4 days calling every BOA phone number I could, only to keep getting a recording and no real person. I finally found a number for the collections for BOA in my notes, I was so scared we where going to lose it as XXXX had said if we did n't pay by 65 days it would be repoed. I finally reached XXXX and she took the payment and I asked why I could n't pay online, she explained because we had XXXX late payments we where locked out of their system. I asked her how was I suppose to pay you if I could n't get ahold of anyone! I told her XXXX had done the 2 month extention and we should be current. She explained she would need another XXXX for us to be current as there was no exten. I asked to speak with XXXX and he told me it was my fault that we did n't get it because I did n't hold up my end and have the payment in by XXXX, I explained why I could n't get it paid, he got angry and I was in tears and had to hang up.Again to many names to list but I finally got ahold of XXXX, I told him the story and he said he would send the paper work for the exten. I missed his second call on the XXXX, I tried for another 4 days to get ahold of him. Finally on the XXXX he said he was sending the paper work but had to be back in 10 days. It was written on XXXX, I received it on XXXX and put it back in the mail at the XXXX. I then get a call on XXXX by XXXX XXXX for full pay. I told him I did the papers, he said no you where denied it got here to late. They where never going to honor the exten. nor help us in anyway. The phone never stops!

258,2318,2015-05-31,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Problems when you are unable to pay,,"I have an auto loan through Mid-Atlantic Finance that is due every two weeks for payment. When I initially received documentation that this company had bought my loan from the dealer I originally got the car from, my payments were due every two weeks. I am paid on a set schedule and have explained to this company that very fact. I recently fell behind on my payments to due financial hardship and other factors such as change and pay as result of company outsourcing. I contacted my finance company to inform them of what had happened and set up a payment arrangement with "" XXXX XXXX '', who is supposedly my account manager. She stated on a recorded line that per the agreement for XXXX, I had to pay {$1000.00} to "" Secure '' my account. Well, I did just that with a payment on XXXX of {$300.00} a payment on XXXX of {$500.00} and {$280.00} on XXXX. So, I called Mid-Atlantic this past Thursday to inform them that I would like to set up payment arrangement for my auto loan for XXXX as of the end of this month, I still owe a balance that is past due. The initial representative laughs and states that I am still past due, places me on hold for ten minutes and cold transfers me to my "" account manager '' who states to secure the account, {$1000.00} has to be paid on the account for XXXX ... If I am not mistaken, the payments that have been made and posted total {$1000.00}. XXXX blatantly states that I had to make a payment of {$200.00} to satisfy the {$1000.00} for the month of XXXX to "" secure '' my account from repossession status. I have done my research on this finance company and did not choose to have them purchase my loan. After clearly stating my situation, being assured that a resolution could be attained without repossession, I feel that this company and it 's morals are out of sync with XXXX another. I simply stated that I would like to pay $ 450- {$550.00} on the XXXX and XXXX of XXXX so that my ending month 's balance would be under {$220.00} as I am currently under by {$760.00} at the moment with payments due every two weeks of {$280.00} ( and then {$290.00} if received late ) and by XXXX XXXX, have my balance at {$0.00} after {$550.00} payment on XXXX XXXX. As you can see, I have calculated with my current salary of {$13.00} an hour from {$10.00} from XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX what I can pay aside from rent, car insurance, etc. I have made this XXXX person aware of my current pay and what I can afford to pay every two weeks to ensure I have a vehicle to get me to work. At this point, I do not know where else to turn. This company calls every day stating I have to call them back by the end of the business day and even does so while on payment arrangements. Is this legal? I mean, I understand that my credit is not superb or else I would have had a finer institution handling my account however, I am still human and this does n't seem legal to demand payment from me after the amount needed to "" secure '' my account has been made. I also emailed this XXXX XXXX and asked if the call can be pulled ( in which I know it can ) so that she could understand that she had stated I needed to pay {$1000.00} for the month of XXXX to keep my account secured and then stated I had to pay another {$200.00} to do just that.

286,85874,2015-10-01,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"I challenge the adverse account designation of Santandar and its predecessor, XXXX XXXX XXXX, on the basis that it is inaccurate, incomplete and reflects a debt that is not mine and that payment accommodations were made but not actuated by XXXX. XXXX violated its agreement regarding payment on all matters which are at issue. Payment was available when scheduled but XXXX transferred the account to SANTANDAR, resulting in untimely and inaccurate accounting and taking of payments from my account. This adverse account must be removed from my credit report. Credit reporting is inaccurate and incomplete. 

BackgroundDuring these periods I had to change my bank account because I found that an online company had compromised my account by taking funds to which it was not authorized. A new account was obtained only to find that the bank transferred the bad and unauthorized payee to the new account. This caused problems in late payment on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I had called XXXX and was informed that they were transferring the account to SANTANDER CONSUMER USA and that their computer system had problems in the transfer during the months of XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX indicated that the payment arrangements I had and made to preclude any problems would be acceptable, however, that was not the case or actuality of theiractions. Accommodations were made for timely payment but not fully instituted when XXXX transferred their accounting files to their new partner, SANTANDER. 


SANTANDER CONSUMER USA ( Herein "" SAN '' ) took over the account of XXXX overseas and with the transfer came a host of problems. New rules and dates for payment were instituted which were not conducive to my payment schedule. I provided for extra funds to be in my account to accommodate the transfer of account by SAN from XXXX. Problems occurred when unauthorized and untimely electronic withdrawals were taken without my consent, as they were not scheduled deposits I had arranged and agreed to. 

These unauthorized and untimely payments were taken on the following dates:XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX ; XXXX ; XXXX ; XXXX ; XXXX and XXXX

We did speak with the dealership and they sent us a check for {$300.00} so we would only be liable for the {$400.00} originally agreed upon.

No matter I gave this specific instructions to evaluate this special case without making the inquiry, they did it without my authorization, and the officers just send a message through XXXX saying "" that is a problem of XXXX XXXX '', that is not their problem, so they made the inquiry and made my credit score even lower, having the evidence on their hands with specific instructions of not making the credit inquiry, no application for the small loan renewal of {$1200.00} was made at XXXX XXXX, and they did n't even took the time to at least call me first at my phone number, or personally at their branch in XXXX, to ask for permission to make the credit inquiry, because they were specifically asked by myself personally, through their representative XXXX, for not to make the credit inquiry. They did n't care, knowing the credit score lowers even more with the inquiry, and they offered to approve the loan renewal at even a higher interest rate than the XXXX offered back in XXXX 2015 when it was made for this amount, at 34.95 % interest, because this error was present, they did n't check or considered that XXXX and XXXX does not have the error posted since XXXX 2015, and the documents I handled to XXXX that were received, also have that evidence, so they simply gave importance precisely to the XXXX XXXX report, F.I.C.O, version I was showing evidence that is affected by this error as if I never spoke to them about it and no evidence was shown and handled to them about it, no matter the previous years of experience with them, they made an unauthorized credit inquiry at XXXX XXXX, not considering the others at all, knowing this lowers the credit score. How they at XXXX XXXX will do something like this, because my previous experience with them was excellent? I was really surprised with this kind of unfair treatment on their part, and not knowing that precisely, you also handle this kind of complaints here, also contacted the XXXX of XXXX. Florida hours ago. But, no confirmation of the complaint was received from them yet through e-mail, and they are not a U.S. Government Federal Agency like you at C.F.P.B, so I noticed I can file this kind of complaint here also minutes ago, that is why I did it. I found about this inquiry, because after rejecting their offer of 36.95 % and {$140.00} payment for this loan renewal, I visited another financial institution were they informed me about an inquiry today, and I simply called XXXX XXXX at the phone number written at the start of this complaint in order to talk to XXXX. I am trying to evidence all this with XXXX more complaints because is not only XXXX XXXX, this banks are like capitalizing with bad practices about all this, as I will show not only with this complaint here and the one against XXXX XXXX, is like a scheme, that is my opinion, they ignore the other credit bureaus, and use the one that allows them to sell for more their loans.

They have replied to an earlier complaint, I have disputed it and have had no response. so here it is. The contract should be NULL and Void as the Main applicant ( XXXX XXXX ) NEVER signed the contract. 
The contract should be deemed null and void. 
1. 
On the contract you can see that the due date is to be the XXXX of each month. When the XXXX payment was made early, ( on the first of the month to be considered for the up-coming payment on the XXXX ). Cps took it upon themselves to change the due date to the XXXX of the month, in the situation, it showed that a payment had been made for the XXXX of the previous month and then due again 2 days later on the XXXX ( which is when the account started showing a delinquency ). XXXX XXXX noticed the account was showing behind, when in fact it was paid ahead. He contacted CPS via phone and was told they had permission to change the due date, he said that neither he nor XXXX XXXX authorized this change, they dismissed it and refused to put the date back to the XXXX. He then asked for a written and signed document from either him or XXXX XXXX, requesting proof of the change, it has been over 4 years and still no such document!!! 
2. 
XXXX XXXX was NOT present at the time of purchase and did NOT sign the contract for the loan. Her son was employed by the selling dealership and was allowed by the selling dealership to purchase and sign the contract for XXXX XXXX, even though she may have given verbal permission over the phone for him to do so, there was NO power of attorney signed. A hand writing analysis can be performed to verify the signature is Not XXXX signature. In fact she was at her place of employment ( working ) XXXX miles away from the selling dealership. ( this can be proved from payroll records. ) 3. 
The vehicle was purchased for a 3rd party, which to the best of my knowledge is NOT allowed by CPS. In fact neither XXXX XXXX nor XXXX XXXX ever driven the vehicle ( the vehicle in question is a manual shift, neither one of them know how to drive a manual transmission. ) The contract itself is not even a CPS contract. Cps has been trying to implement policies and fees off of someone else 's contract. The contract is on an XXXX contract, and only has CPS ( hand written ) on it, with NO address or phone contact information for CPS. 

For any one or all of the above reasons, the contract should be considered NULL and VOID, and the vehicle returned to CPS, with all and any Balances removed, and the loan as a whole be removed from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX credit reports considering she NEVER signed the contract in the first place. 
We have copies of the contract and XXXX XXXX Signature that can be provided, we can also go to a notary public to verify her signature if needed.

376,27812,2015-07-17,Credit card,,Delinquent account,,"I live in the state of VA and was unexpectedly hit with personal property taxes and only had 3 weeks to pay by the time I received the notice by mail. I was not prepared for this as I have not lived here in over 10 years. In order to resolve that issue some bills where not paid on time .. which would include the credit card for which I have the complaint with. My account is up to date and even though my payment was late it was not 30-60 days past due which is what they reported on my credit which had a very significant impact and I am currently trying to improve my credit in order to be able to buy a home. When I called them to discuss this and requested that they show me a courtesy of removing the delinquency from my credit as my account was paid and is up to date and this was the only instance for which I was late, as I always pay before my due date. I was told that they can not remove the delinquency from my report as they have no way of reversing the report they submit to the credit bureaus. I informed them that I have spoke with the credit bureaus and know that they can electronically respond to my dispute I made with them the previous day and the credit bureau stated once they receive that response it will up date immediately so if I need it removed soon to contact the company directly. So again the agent continues to repeat annoyingly over and over we can not change what we submitted unless we made the error. They proceeded to tell me if I had a dispute I would have to file it with them personally in writing and mail it to their dispute center and wait for them to review and make a decision which will take 30-60 days maybe up to 90 days. I kept explaining that their negative report affected me within a minute of them reporting it and can just as easily reverse it, if they would be willing to extend me that courtesy, however, they would not. I asked for another supervisor as the one I was talking to kept talking over me and saying the same thing over and over, she then placed me on hold for 15 minutes when another woman came on the line I explained the situation yet again. She stated well since you admitted to being a little late there was no error on our part, I said a little late is not 30-60 days delinquent but irregardless I was simply asking for a one time courtesy since I have never had a late payment ever and as a matter of fact they were always paid early. She agreed that this has never happened before on my account but still continued telling me that I would now need to submit my complaint in writing and mail it to them, even after I told her that I filed a dispute with the credit reporting agency and all they need to do is respond. When I mentioned I was filing a complaint with CFPB she then stated now I have to transfer you to the president line and immediately did so, and where I got a voicemail asking me to leave a name and number and a brief description of the issue. I only have 2 weeks before I loose the opportunity to refinance my vehicle from 12.99 % to 1 % and they are the only thing holding that up and the smallest account I have and giving me the biggest issue.

This was never disclosed to me in any form or fashion. Other companies are able to specify which type of line the payment should go to "" Specify where my payments are applied '' for example, but this company does not. Furthermore, I was given the wrong date to pay that promotional amount off, which has adversely caused me to be very stressed as I intended to pay it off when it was due and not earlier, they said a date earlier. I called again and got another date so now I really do n't know when it is due. I called to ask for my balance transfer consumer agreement and they advised that they could not give me that either. I asked where the general terms are, and they could not provide that. It is not in the best interest of the customer to apply a monthly payment to the line of credit with the lowest interest or to a promotion amount before applying it to an amount with the highest interest rate. That also happened without my consent. Their terms for "" How my payment is applied '' state that "" Generally, they apply it in a certain form or fashion, I as a consumer need to understand what "" generally '' means, and how I can be satisfied by being able to make a payment to a promotional offer in its entirety without having to pay also purchases that were made afterwards that have no end date for incurring interest.

At this time, I was told that they did not receive the statement of fraud ( or could not locate ) and I was asked to fax the statement of fraud. As requested, I faxed the statement of fraud directly to them and was told that it would take 30-90 days to resolve. Keep in mind, that I originally mailed the statement of fraud in XXXX. I asked for confirmation of receipt of the statement but no one contacted me as I requested. On XXXX XXXX, I called again and to request a status and was told that it was it their system but there was no current status to provide. I was only told that it would be taken care of and not to worry. I was also told not to pay anything over the original amount that did belong to me which was a very small amount as my fraud claim would be rejected if I paid any of the fraudulent charges. I have continued to make minimum payments, as instructed, but I am now at the point where the minimum payment is more than what I owe. I called back again on XXXX XXXX, still no update. I am only told to continue to make minimum payments or I will be assessed a late charge - contradicting the previous communication that I received to not make payments towards the fraudulent charges. I am extremely frustrated by the lack of urgency or action on the part of the Macy 's Fraud Department.

It could be XXXX, or XXXX, or XXXX. It could be different for each applicant ; meaning that the criteria is completely arbitrary and can be implemented in a discriminatory manner. 
They could not articulate why the number of different cards I have received and used responsibly provides any indication of credit unworthiness.

Chase said they could take an internal complaint, but could not tell me of any impact or process that complaints generate, other than that they are sent to an "" escalation '' department.

It was left on my doorstep by the postman. I took the unopened package to the post office and returned it to the sender with a tracking number so I had proof it was returned.

The balance transfer came with a 0 % finance rate for about 9 months. I made payments on time and before the promo rate expired, I paid off the remaining balance.

I believe Chase arbitrarily reduced my credit limits as 'punishment ' for paying off the balance and avoiding finance fees.

The original price of the computer was {$790.00}, however the doorbuster deal was {$540.00}. I submitted my credit card information, twice, within 3 minutes and XXXX times were declined. Assuming this was an issue with XXXX ( due to traffic volume ), the option to pay through XXXX was also available. I submitted my credit information through XXXX and it was accepted. I received an email ( attached ) stating the payment was accepted and XXXX would contact me soon to confirm processing. 
Within 1-2 hours, I received an automated call from PNC for loss prevention, checking on the charges. The first XXXX charges were noted as "" declined, '' which I accepted ( because they were ) and the third charge, through XXXX, was noted as "" approved, '' which I also accepted. I did not receive any other calls or emails throughout the holiday weekend regarding the purchase.

Wednesday, XXXX XXXX, I chose to further the investigating. XXXX Customer Service confirmed that PNC DECLINED the purchase on Thursday, XXXX XXXX, therefore my order was never processed and I would not be receiving the discounted computer. 
After speaking with multiple PNC Customer Service Reps on Wednesday, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX of them basic reps, XXXX of them Retail Escalation, XXXX of them a manager and still waiting on a return call from the direct supervisor of the manager ), the conclusion ( and these words came directly from the manager ) was that "" After you approved the payment through the automated system on XXXX, it was your responsibility to go back in and submit the payment, AGAIN. "" When has this ever happened?? I have never experienced a situation with a credit card that the purchase needed to be submitted AGAIN after an automated system. I told the Retail Escalation Manager that they prevented me from making a purchase on a sale item and I have now lost out on a savings of {$250.00}. What would be the point for me to keep a credit card with their company if I could n't use it on large purchases ( OF ONLY {$500.00} )? 

I am requesting compensation from PNC Bank, in the amount in which I have lost out on the deal ( {$250.00} ). Someone on their end completely messed up and they are refusing to take responsibility for their actions. An apology is not enough. I am a very loyal customer, have been with PNC for almost 10 years now, always pay off the credit card and although I so much appreciate the prevention of fraudulent activity, it has completely screwed me. They neglected to inform me that the last transaction through XXXX was never submitted and to me, this is completely unacceptable.

Bank of America has violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( "" FCRA '' ) sections 623 ( a ), 623 ( b ), and 605 ( c ) on multiple occasions by re-aging Bank of America account # XXXX, which has caused myself irrevocable harm. Bank of America has reported three ( 3 ) separate DOFD dates in regards Bank of America account # XXXX on at least three ( 3 ) separate occasions, including the most recent on XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ). Each occasion constitutes XXXX ( XXXX ) violations, as information was provided to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ), Bank of America reported the Date of First Delinquency ( "" DOFD '' ) to account # XXXX to reflect XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ). In XXXX ( XXXX ) earlier reports provided by Bank of America to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, the DOFD date was reported to reflect XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ) and XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ). In total, Bank of America has reported XXXX ( XXXX ) DOFD dates on account # XXXX resulting in re-aging this account XXXX ( XXXX ) times, via incorrect reporting provided to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 

Bank of America does not have documentation on this account prior to XX/XX/XXXX. Per the account statement of XX/XX/XXXX, the account was past due {$1600.00}. In addition, statements provided via DV requests from creditors show the account was never brought current from XX/XX/XXXX, and a DOFD can not be determined without documentation prior to XX/XX/XXXX. It is appallingly apparent that prior CRA reporting is incorrect on this account, as there can not be ( XXXX ) XXXX separate DOFD dates on the same account. 

Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act states : ( A ) Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors. A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. 

Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act states : ( B ) Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors. A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate ; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. 

By law, Bank of America should be fined {$15000.00} or greater for violations due to repeated incorrect reporting on this account. Unlike the FDCP, the FCRA allows for multiple fines and additional compensation for irreparable harm caused by incorrect reporting to credit reporting agencies. 

Section 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act states : ( E ) if an item of information disputed by a consumer is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified after any reinvestigation under paragraph ( 1 ), for purposes of reporting to a consumer reporting agency only, as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation promptly- ( i ) modify that item of information ; ( ii ) delete that item of information ; or ( iii ) permanentlyPer section 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, this account must immediately be deleted from my credit report unless Bank of America can provide documentation explaining why XX/XX/XXXX is the correct DOFD, which is impossible, given that XX/XX/XXXX is the Charge-Off date on the account.

573,28992,2015-04-24,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Public record,"This issue is in reference to a public record for a tax lien that was released in XXXX. The West Virginia XXXX XXXX office failed to release the lien at the time of settlement. This was not completed until XXXX. The state office stated that it was not possible to retroactively change the release date in their computer systems. Instead, they noted the official court document with the correct date and provided me with a copy. 

I submitted disputes with the XXXX primary credit reporting agencies. XXXX of them accepted the updated court documents and immediately changed the entries. In XXXX ( XXXX years after the lien ), the entries dropped off as they should. 

Equifax refuses to change the release date and still report it as XXXX. This means that the record will remain on my credit report until XXXX. 

Even worse, the public record appears on their report in XXXX separate entries. There is XXXX using the court booking number ( beginning with XXXX ), the other using the state lien file number ( beginning with XXXX ). Everything is the same about these XXXX entries except for those XXXX numbers. The lien dollar amount, the date filed, the state it was filed from, the XXXX release date, the contact information for the state office are identical. 

Multiple disputes have been opened over the last two years. For all of them I either emailed, faxed, or physically mailed the updated court document with contact information for the Tax Compliance department. Several Equifax CSRs verbally confirmed that they see the correction on the document. They also confirmed that the public records are duplicated. Even so, the final investigation results dispute comes back with the same conclusion. 

I have followed Equifax process and received no resolution to my problem. At this point, I will have to seek legal counsel.

Selecting none of the above for each one of these causes a failure in identity verification ( again, on equifax only, I had no issues whatsoever with XXXX or XXXX. ) and tells me to MAIL ( yeah, sending sensitive information through the mail is a really good and secure idea, there ... ) copies of payroll stubs, ect. This same thing happened last year ... If there was a case of identity theft I 'm sure it would have shown up on my other XXXX reports, which it did not. Why is such a group of incompetent ( and ignorant from what I 've gathered over the web, since I 'm not the only one experiencing this ) morons in charge of peoples credit like this? It seems the easiest course of action with them is to subscribe to their service to remedy this, which seems an awful lot like bate and switch, which last time I checked was still illegal ( not to mention immoral, not that today 's businesses readily practice moral or ethical means of operation ). They are screwing over MANY Americans on a daily basis with these practices and should be shut down until they can get their heads out of their butts and shape up, yet these are the people in charge of our credit. This makes as much sense as a chocolate teapot ...

The credit report was for myself and my husband. When I became suspicious because of other things that did n't seem right, I learned that the mortgage company has had an expired license since 2009. Then I asked the licensed real estate agent who did the paperwork in the licensed real estate broker office. I asked the agent why the mortgage company is unlicensed. He said it is because the company was his and that he closed it in 2009 but that he kept the account with CREDCO so that he could run reports on people. CREDCO has not responded to my email about it. It seems to me that CREDCO should know whether or not its customers are even in business, especially after 7 years of being closed. CREDCO has a duty to protect sensitive financial information from thieves. There was no way for me to know ahead of time that I was dealing with an unlicensed mortgage company. Beyond that, because I was in a licensed office with a licensed agent, it NEVER occurred to me that I would be victimized like this. That 's wrong. Very wrong. It is CREDCO 's fault for not knowing that their customer has been out of business for 7 years. Now we are open to identity theft. I have a copy of the CREDCO report issued to XXXX XXXX MORTGAGE.

In XXXX the credit bureau places on my credit a tax lein of {$290.00} on both my names and spouses.

I called both the Ohio Attorney General XXXX and collection and the XXXX XXXX Court Clerk of records Divison that reported that it should not be on my credit and they stated they were not reporting to the bureau, instead they claim that this is the bureaus error. 
I pulled my credit and it shows unpaid {$290.00} for a tax lien by XXXX agencies, in addition this debt was in XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and it has been reporting beyond the ( XXXX limit for paid tax liens.

A number of years ago, a distant relative established an identity utilizing my middle and last names with alternative residence, identification, and social security information. He was then able to secure credit, a residence and even an on-going vehicle loan. I have worked diligently to have these items removed over the years. As often as I have been able to, I have contacted creditors to have statements and accounts forwarded to me for legal purposes and to contest debts. There is a fraud affidavit affixed to my credit report, as well as other protections to prevent new accounts from being established. Now Roquemore & Roquemore is calling threatening my family members and demanding that the location of a vehicle be disclosed. I reiterate that this is not my account, I do not possess this vehicle and we have no contact with the family member that committed the fraud. The fraudulent social security number ends in XXXX, which is NOT my social security number. When I attempted to call and explain this, the representative presumed that I was lying and became livid and started screaming. I asked that they provide me an address where I could submit proof of this being a case of fraud, yet she threatened that continued calls to my family, landlords, employers and the like would continue if I did not provide the vehicle. I have promptly called an attorney and had them to draft a cease and desist order. They ( Roquemore & Roquemore ) have made no efforts to validate this debt, or it would become blatantly obvious that they do not have my true social security number or name. The original creditor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) employed the same tactic of skip-tracing and attempted to add my full name and social security number to the account, which warranted the item being removed XXXX by the credit bureaus.

This was agreed with the agent since I do not give my personal information to persons who direct call me regardless of the phone number that is calling. I then proceeded to the website and made a payment within minutes of speaking to the agent. I also at that time requested they not contact me with auto dialed collection calls. XXXX Hours later I received an automated call. I then hung up, and called the company and got in touch with another agent and stated that I have a pending payment on record, and to please stop calling me. He stated that they would not stop calling me unless I wanted to make another payment over the phone. At which point I brought up my stance on giving information over the phone and the fact that if they called me once in a day that I would most likely not have additional money the XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX time during the day. He then stated that they could call at least XXXX times in the day with no penalty. That in my book is still harassment.

Since this company failed to notify me of the debt in a timely manner and failed to allow me to dispute it, I can not rent with any other landlords.

1068,118625,2016-04-19,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"On the date of XXXX XXXX, 2016, I filed a complaint against Stellar Recovery, case number, XXXX, for reporting to my credit reports I owed a debt which I did not owe. 
Stellar Recovery responded to my complaint by advising the CFPB they [ Stellar Recovery ] were removing the account from my credit reports. 
As of the date of this second complaint Stellar Recovery has refused to honor its promise to the CFPB and is still reporting to my XXXX credit report I owe a debt which I do not owe and an account that Stellar Recovery promised the CFPB and me they were removing from my credit report. 
I sent three letters to Stellar Recovery demanding the removal of their negative reporting. All letters were ignored. 
I the emailed the chief complaint officer for Stellar Recovery demanding removal of the account and even attached to my demand a federal lawsuit I would file if Stellar Recovery continued to violate the law and its promise to the CFPB. 
Stellar Recovery ignored my emails and as of the date of this complaint continues to report to my credit in a negative manner, violations of the FCRA and the FDCPA. 
I have now been forced to retain an attorney and a federal Complaint has been filed on XXXX XXXX, 2016, case number XXXX, XXXX XXXX of Arkansas. 
However, even after the filing of a federal lawsuit against Stellar Recovery, they still refuse to remove the negative and illegal reporting from my XXXX credit report. As the CFPB is well aware, a universal data form being faxed to a credit bureau will have the account removed in less than 24 hours. 
Stellar Recovery has lied to and thumbed its nose to the CFPB, even though it is facing a federal lawsuit. If the power and authority of the CFPB does not find this case worthy of using its authority to regulate this collection agency, then I am not sure what kind of case would be ripe? 
I am bringing this agency to justice on the civil side, and the CFPB should use its authority to send a message that conduct such as that of Stellar Recovery will not be permitted against consumers and against the CFPB. 
It is worth noting again that Stellar Recovery failed to respond to ALL communications to them to further discuss this matter and work with the consumer to resolve this issue. 
Thank You

When I spoke with them, I advised them that I am able to pay the balance of what I owe, {$3500.00}. They, instead, advise me that I now owe {$5200.00} on this balance. 

I conducted my own research on this company as I was having issues with fraudulant activity occurring on my account. Upon doing this, I found that many individuals have incurred unfortunate situations with this company as I have already ; to include paying their balance with funds continuing to be taken out of their incoming funds. I have personally encountered obscene, profane and abusive language, threats of garnishing wages, freezing any bank accounts and that they would take any check I have until they get the full {$5200.00} amount owed. They additionally threatened to freeze my SSN and advised me that they will make sure that I will not be able to make any purchases or obtain any new jobs until they get their full amount of {$5200.00} owed. Their lack of professionalism or willingness to work with me in any way was not provided to me as an option. Additionally, they continue to not provide me with a valid explanation as to why there was {$1700.00} additional dollars added onto the amount I owe. Upon the instances where I tried to contact this company, I have been hung up on XXXX times, deferred to other individuals who claimed they were unable to help me, and when I was able to finally reach someone, obscence language was used along with given multiple threats with no help being offered. Again, I am able to pay my balance of what I owe, {$3500.00}, but they are not giving me this option and are not advising me of why these additional charges have occurred. I 'm unsure of how to proceed, but would like this matter taken care of. I would like to pay my balance, but will not provide money to a company that has a history of "" losing '' balances paid and will not provide me with an explanation of why the account increased.

I had a medical bill from XXXX XXXX XXXX that was forwarded to Med-1 Solutions, LLC. The bill was from XX/XX/XXXX. I was unable to pay the bill do to my financial situation at the time it was incurred. I was unable to make payments on the debt during this period because of continued financial hardship. I received a notice from Med-1 that they would be taking me to court for the bill XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The week prior to the court date I called and spoke with one of their representatives in their legal department. I advised her of my financial situation and asked if I would be able to make payment arrangements for the bill. She said I could. We worked out arrangements were I would make {$100.00} payments on the XXXX of each month, starting XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. She stated that she would forward me paperwork that I would need to fill out for them to deduct the payments automatically from my account. I agreed to do so. I received the paperwork the following week. I had not sent the paperwork back with my account information so they could start deducting the {$100.00} agreed upon amount on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, when I noticed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that Med-1 had deducted a {$100.00} payment from my checking account on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. This caused me to be quite embarrassed when I went to purchase lunch and was informed my card was being declined. I was also charged a {$37.00} overdraft fee on my account because their payment caused me to go in the negative. I called Med 1 that day and advised a representative of what happened. She said that she saw that arrangement in the notes pertaining to the {$100.00} payments starting on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and did not know why the payment was taken out XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I asked the representative how they obtained my bank account information since I had never sent them their paperwork back yet and that I would like to be reimbursed the {$37.00} fee. She could not answer that question and advised that she would have a supervisor listen to the call and get back with me. That has been over a month and I have yet to receive a call back. Since then I have received another collection notice from Med-1 for another XXXX XXXX XXXX bill that I have disputed with the original creditor. I have not contacted Med-1 since.

It is XXXX XXXX that owns XXXX companies. They intentionally go after low income people and then harass them. I did n't even give them my new address. 

They hit my credit info to find out my new address and sent me a letter demanding the full amount of which has been quadrupled from the regular amount of the original creditor. They refused to give me their phone number because they believe that it will make it harder for me to serve them. 

I have given them until XX/XX/XXXX to respond or I am filing in the state of New Hampshire in small claims and I WILL cost them more than the debt is worth. 

***Additional note to add. I forgot to include this I believe with my previous complaint against LVNV Funding/Resurgent Capital Services. It is my belief that the Sherman Financial group LLC owns all XXXX of these companies and operates them as shell companies. 

I wish I had known back in 2008 when I let these companies hook me into taking their cards out that they would NEVER let me escape them.

The primary reason use PayPal is for the protections I thought they provided. That and until very recently had no choice when using ebay although I still chose to use PayPal for the protection. I found myself in a bad situation where a seller on ebay sent a defective item and in the end, PayPal refused to provide the protection that they are compensated for. Processing companies make insane money for what are mostly automated transactions. They earn their money when consumers need protection and that includes against unreasonable policies where in this case, it ended up being PayPal 's policies and inability to apply common sense to the situation. After spending {$130.00} on the water heater which was defective upon arrival, the seller and PayPal found it reasonable that I would then be required to spend {$90.00} in return shipping since the seller was out of the country but yet chose to do biz in the US and knowingly is offering products where such issues will be inevitable from time to time ( no manufacturing process is perfect ).

Based on the recommendation of my real estate agent, I had notified the PNC bank on XXXX XXXX, 2016 to go ahead and order an appraisal and I signed all my mortgage paperwork on XXXX XXXX. My contract was ratified on XXXX XXXX and the appraisal contingency was due at XXXX on XXXX XXXX. Despite my reminders to the PNC loan officer about the appraisal due date multiple times, I did not receive the appraisal report until XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX. I went over the appraisal report the first chance I got and had noticed some gross mistakes, including "" full size washer and dryer in bedroom closet, '' and "" whirlpool tub '' which neither exists. I sent the loan officer an email with full description of the mistakes among others at XXXX. Almost a week later now on XXXX XXXX at XXXX, I still have not received a correct appraisal report. The loan officer was trying to argue that the appraisal report WAS sent before the deadline -- -but with multiple mistakes that could indeed impact the appraised value?? PNC bank while having had my ratified contract around XXXX XXXX still missed the appraisal contingency which resulted me not being able to negotiate to the potentially lower appraised value. I have contacted the PNC customer service who was supposed to connect me with the supervisor of the branch manager as the brank manager ( XXXX ) has been out of town all week, but the supervisor, XXXX XXXX XXXX refused to speak to me and ended up sending someone from the Branch who sounds very young and completely inexperienced on management skills. XXXX XXXX XXXX did not introduce himself when he came on the line for who knows how long after I had waited for several minutes. He basically had nothing to add but just told me to keep waiting. I am curious in this case, what rights do I have as a consumer and what recourse do I have that a bank such as PNC which failed to meet the appraisal contingency and pretended that the grossly inaccurate report was their extent of obligation to fulfill the appraisal contingency? I am XXXX for 4 years and just returned to the XXXX area and a bit puzzled about the mortgage business practice. Sincerely appreciate CFPB 's help.

I have hired an attorney to help me with the process. The attorney 's in house underwriter states I qualify for a regular XXXX modification. Bank of America now states I do not qualify for a regular modification due to XXXX / Investor non-approval. I have not received any denial letters or explanations. We believe there may be an error in some of the information the investor is using to make this determination such as the value of the property or similar. Bank of America has also started foreclosure by filing a Notice of Default on XXXX XXXX, 2015. They did not review me in a timely manner that last time I applied for assistance. They stalled and took 76 days to review me. This is after they filed the Notice of Default against me, thereby burning all of my time waiting for them. Per my attorney, this is wrong and I believe illegal as it violates Respa Reg X- Regarding timelines for reviewing someone for foreclosure assistance, especially after a Notice of Default is filed. I am told they were supposed to review me within 30 days of having a complete package. They received my complete financial package on XXXX XXXX, 2015. My attorney confirmed they received the package and that it was complete on XXXX XXXX, 2015. However, they did not make a decision until XXXX XXXX, 2015. I have attached notes from my attorney 's calls to the lender. You can see they did not review me in a timely manner. It feels like they stalled on purpose and then intentionally denied me solely to reach the 90 day mark where they can now set a sale date and I have run out of time to save my house. They give no reason for the denial and now they have burned all my time to be able to correct what ever errors they made while reviewing me to save my home. I am told by my attorney that the timelines set by RESPA Reg x to review someone for loss mitigation assistance within 30 days of submitting a complete financial package were set up this way because lenders were stalling and then just setting sale dates. I fear this is my case. Bank of America seems to have burned two and a half months sitting on my application. This is after foreclosure was started and my timeline to a sale date is also running out. They are not not giving me the reason for my denial and as of XXXX XXXX, they can now set a sale date leaving me no time to figure out how to save my home. Attached you will find notes from my attorney 's office proving Bank of America sat on my loan modification request and has burned my time since my Notice of Default putting me into a bad situation now facing a Notice of Sale.

Ocwen Loan Servicing bought a Fraudulent Loan Modification from AHMSI and it is designed for my payments to keep going up year after year until I ca n't afford to pay it anymore! Meanwhile Ocwen 's house ( the one I live in and pay for ) keeps going up in value. So after I can not pay the mortgage anymore ... Ocwen can foreclose and make money after I paid for this thing for all those years. 
They deny the Modification because I am current on loan payments and can afford to pay right now. I do have a few bucks in the bank, but I have also had a transplant, and if/when I have a problem and need specialty meds, I will need every dime I ca n't get my hands on! They do n't understand that! 
Secondly, I was forced to sell some income property that I owned, because I had to borrow against it when I was sick and on a transplant list. The loan was from a personal friend ( my realtor ) and no interest was charged, so nothing was documented. So, when the property was sold, I showed a huge capital gain tax and owe the IRS over XXXX! 
So, now I have no income off of property that was sold, I owe IRS $ $ , and my modified loan payments keep going up! I try to explain this to OCWEN and they just want me to spend every dime I have so they can foreclose! I have read Horror stories about Ocwen 's slimy history and I 'm worried. 
During the modification process, Ocwen assigns me a Relationship Manager! The RM has no direct phone # and only one number to the Loan Modification Department that you wait on hold forever, or talk to someone other than your personal RM! I have scheduled appointments with my Personal Relationship Manager and always end up talking to someone else instead! XXXX? 
What other options do I have? Ocwen Loan Servicing are major crooks! They go to court, get fined and just keep on doing their business as usual ... XXXX their customers!

We were told to contact the State 's Attorney 's office which in my state of Illinois is XXXX XXXX. We submitted documentation of what happen and to no avail which now is years passing nothing has happen. I kept all original documentation also, email them and no-one has responded. The problem is when things are on your credit you ca n't get any assistance. The lending company we were with was Option One a predatory lender of XXXX XXXX who to this date is still in business. Also, in the state of Illinois I thought a house could n't be sold if there were liens against it. Well that property was sold and now the XXXX mrtg or whatever was taken out against it has been transferred to someone else called XXXX XXXX and it is on the credit and is ruining everything. I have in my possession letters written to modify the mortgage also, there was an offer and it was denied which forced a foreclosure to the home. It 's very hard to move forward with your credit in a disarray. Any help or direction you can provide for my family will greatly be appreciated.

At this time her son became unreachable. I call WELLS FARGO to ask if a payment was made. They refused to tell me that or anything else regarding the mortgage. That was back in around XXXX or XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to the present ... I finally got letters of special administration in XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and the house is in foreclosure. Not knowing if the son was making payments, and not knowing if WELLS FARGO has legal standing to foreclose. WELLS FARGO ( current servicer, ), through XXXX XXXX XXXX ( not the original title co., I was not informed there was a different title co. the original was LAWYERS TITLE INSURANCE CORP. ) I do n't know if the original trust account was dissolved, if so when. I do n't even know the name of the trust account. WELLS FARGO knows my wife is deceased yet, they call the house asking for her, day after day. I hate having to tell people that my wife is dead. Do n't they make a note, or communicate to anyone at their company? I am going to mail them my LETTERS OF SPECIAL ADMINISTRATION, a second CERTIFICATE OF DEATH, MY QUALIFIED WRITTEN REQUEST, a COPY OF XXXX OF YOUR PUBLICATIONS DESCRIBING AN IDENTICAL SCENARIO TO MINE, AND A COVER LETTER. I do n't know what can be done at this point, and all the pain with not having my wife here makes mine an enormously stressful environment, which I am not understanding it 's necessity. Thank you

1561,55532,2015-11-11,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"XX/XX/XXXX I was leaving the Army and looking to buy a house with my then fianc and our teenaged children. As first time home buyers we were qualified for a XXXX loan. We found a home in our price range and I carefully chose XXXX Bank because they were least likely to sell our mortgage. One year later, they sold our mortgage XXXX, which was taken over XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 
This was the worst possible outcome. After carefully avoiding XXXX during the mortgage buying process, here we were. The first thing they did was raise our mortgage from {$1700.00} per month to {$2500.00} per month citing a deficiency in the escrow account. We struggled to keep up, sold family heirlooms, cashed out our annuities, anything to keep from losing the house. Four months later, they lowered the payments to {$2100.00} per month, but we were getting fewer hours due to the weather and it was still too much for us to pay. We were able to keep it up for a year, but XX/XX/XXXX we were laid-off. My husband and I are both XXXX. The financial crisis may have taken a bit longer to get to us than the rest of the workforce, but it hit us with a vengeance. Our friends were getting help with their loans from the government, and they recommended we try to do the same. 
We tried for a year to get a loan mod, but were told that we did not qualify because we were still making payments and in order to qualify we would have to be behind on payments by three months. What they did n't tell us is that penalties would continue to accrue. 
We stopped making payments and applied for the loan mod again. XXXX asked us to fax over XXXX pages costing us XXXX dollars, but at least we would have our application in and we would finally get help. A month passed, and XXXX contacted us to send the exact same paperwork again, they had allowed the paperwork to expire and if we wanted to mod we had no choice but to resend everything. This was to be a monthly theme where we would spend over XXXX dollars to send them paperwork and they would ignore it until it was expired. All we could do was continue to send the same paperwork to XXXX every month and hope that one day they would actually review it. 
Finally XX/XX/XXXX XXXX let us know that our mortgage would be reduced by only XXXX dollars a month. It turned out that all of the payments that we missed plus all of the interest and penalties, fees and so forth was added to the mortgage. They did n't even lower the interest rate. Six months later XXXX cashed out our P & I insurance and the loan went back XXXX who then sold it to Rushmore Loan Management XX/XX/XXXX. Once again I began negotiating to keep the house. Rushmore told us that we would have to come up with a down payment of at least {$8000.00} in order to get a loan modification. We started the paperwork all over again and this time we were successful. They gave us a six month trial payment of {$2100.00} per month. 
When the new paperwork came in, we were not able to hire a lawyer to look it over carefully, but we read it the best we could. It was n't until we had already signed it and sent it back that we realized that not only had they not reduced our loan payments, but they had tacked another ten years onto the mortgage. Our {$210000.00} home would end up costing us almost XXXX XXXX dollars by the time it was paid off, and we would never be able to pay it off during our lifetime, since we are almost XXXX. Then Rushmore raised our mortgage to {$2200.00} per month, citing a deficiency in the escrow account. They are likely to push us into foreclosure so they can also cash out on our P & I insurance.

Back-dating a Notice requiring hazard insurance coverage on my condominium unit within 45 days. Only really giving me 15 days. 
Illegal Insurance Binder on Ocwen 's letter head, with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Also at the bottom of the alleged insurance binder it says "" This communication is from a debt collector attempting to collect a debt ... '' How can a real insurance binder be a debt collector and be on Ocwen 's letterhead? 
I purchased my condo unit and obtained a conventional mortgage on XXXX XXXX, XXXX which did not require interior improvement insurance coverage. My mortgage is not FHA, XXXX or XXXX XXXX loan. All that had to be furnished in terms of insurance coverage was the condo master policy which has always been in force and in place. For the last 10 years, XXXX XXXX XXXX has never been a requirement or an issue. Now after 10 years, Ocwen is force placing lender insurance retroactively to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for an unknown reason, alleging the insurance coverage is for the fixtures, equipment and replacement of improvements and betterments in the unit. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is the name of the alleged insurance company ; however the insurance binder does not cover any of the items Ocwen is requiring insurance coverage for. The Certificate on Ocwen 's letterhead states "" the certificate only covers buildings and structures. It does not cover the contents or personal property, nor does it provide the property liability coverage. '' This alleged coverage is already covered by my condominium master policy and Ocwen has the master policies which have never lapsed. This makes no sense whatsoever and they are trying to charge me an extra {$2400.00} for this nonsense. There is something terribly wrong here, which shocks the conscience and does not sit well with me as a consumer and mortgage customer for over 10 years. 
Ocwen can not retroactively require insurance coverage on my loan dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for the fixtures, equipment and replacement of improvements and betterments within the unit. Yesterday- XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a letter from Ocwen dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX stating it 's the second and final notice requiring internal insurance coverage for the inside contents of my condo unit within 45 days, which is improper. The back-dated letter only provides me 15 days. It 's dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX and I received it XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I check my mail timely and it does not take 30 days to get a letter to XXXX from XXXX. When I mentioned this to Ocwen this morning, they said the letter was sent on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I said this is impossible to send a letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX on a future date, 2 days before, I said perhaps it was sent on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and that is why I just got it on XXXX XXXX, XXXX that makes more sense. They denied this and stuck to the story that it was mailed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
I just called Ocwen to resolve this issue and was told this is a requirement and I need to provide coverage from XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, although my loan was originated prior in XXXX XXXX and this was never required. I do n't know where they are getting this requirement but the property is already underwater, and this will be a financial hardship to force place lender insurance coverage for coverage I already have. The forced place insurance does not even cover what they are illegally asking me to provide for inside my unit. This is unfair, unaffordable and will cause me to fall behind on my mortgage payments and fall into foreclosure which I do not want to happen.

I have called no less than 8 times trying to straighten this matter out and be able to pay my mortgage electronically and have been told that they can not correct the problem. I am tired of the poor customer service, harassing phone calls and late fees as well as damage to my credit report and they have only had my mortgage for 5 months. It is not a good indicator and the fact that they are allowed to operate in such a disturbing manner is alarming.

1682,101587,2015-12-16,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"My complaint is due to my divorce and primarily involves my HELOC, though my first mortgage ( fixed rate Home Equity, really ) is with the same lender. I will remain with my kids in the home and want to assume both the Home Equity and the HELOC ( or have my ex-husband 's name removed ) but I 've been unsuccessful. I 've submitted a complaint previously but ca n't dispute the response, possibly due to the age of my complaint, but research takes time. I 've had a chance to review my HELOC docs and have several issues. First, my ex and I both believed the HELOC was secured by a different residence that he 'll be keeping ( no loans attached ). The docs do n't state what property secures the HELOC. After many calls to my lender, and much confusion on the part of my lender during research, I 've been told that the home in which I reside secures both loans. Next, I 've researched some info re : "" due on sale clause '' being one of the only tools available to lenders to prevent assumptions. I ca n't locate this clause in my HELOC docs, so I 'm wondering if that may only apply to first mortgages. Whether it applies only to first mortgages or to the HELOC, as well, I 've been told by my lender that I ca n't "" assume '' my loans nor can I have my ex removed. If my lender is incorrect in prohibiting me from removing my ex, I 'd like to know how I should proceed. If THAT does n't help my situation, I 'd like to know if the 1982 Garn-St Germain Act applies, and if so, how I should proceed. Finally, my HELOC docs state that instructions for some types of transactions may be made by one borrower without requiring all borrowers to sign ( though reinstatements for borrowing, etc., must be made by all borrowers ). I 'd simply like to instruct my lender to remove liability from the second borrower. My requests for the past 4 years have been denied. I 've shown my ability to pay without a second borrower for the past 4+ years, without any late payments, and I also have liquid assets equal to many months of payments. Aside from the proof of my ability to pay, could my divorce documents be presented to my lender to accomplish my request? We currently own XXXX houses together, XXXX without any loans whatsoever, which my ex will be retaining, and making monthly payments to me. I own the one house mentioned above with a mortgage and HELOC as well as XXXX additional homes without any loans whatsoever. I 'm requesting assistance again due to new information and my inability to convince my lender that I 'm just as trustworthy as I was when I applied for my loans with my ex as co-borrower. I 've always made the payments without his assistance, but as mentioned, can prove I 've made payments for more than 4 years without his assistance. Any help you can provide is appreciated. I 've mentioned a couple of scenarios above that I 've run across while researching, but if there are other options that will help me achieve my goal, please let me know.

1731,116371,2015-11-30,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I attempted to obtain a HARP Loan Modification from Merrill Lynch Mort XXXX.. 
In XXXX 2015, I submitted an application to XXXX, ( XXXX ) an approved U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Counseling Center located in XXXX Florida for assistance in obtaining a Loan Modification from Merrill Lynch MortgageThis was my second attempt for a Loan Modification under the Making Home Affordable Program. The first time was in XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXX And XXXX XXXX XXXX, ( XXXX ) located in XXXX XXXX XXXX, Florida. 
In both instances the Merrill Lynch Mortgage Company would not communicate with the HUD counselor and contacted me directly which caused quite a conflict. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted my assigned counselor, XXXX XXXX at XXXX to determine the status of my Loan Modification request since it had been over two months since I had submitted my documents. I was told by XXXX XXXX that the counselor from Merrill Lynch would not call her back. 
After going back and forth with XXXX XXXX and not getting any where I contacted Merrill Lynch Directly. I was assigned a counselor to work with, XXXX XXXX, ( she remembered me from my previous request ). With her assistance and guidance I resubmitted all requested documents. On XX/XX/XXXX a completed package was submitted and received on XX/XX/XXXX. At that point my Mortgage was three months in arrears. I asked XXXX XXXX for advice on paying the arrearage, she told me she had received all of my documents and it appeared as if I could qualify for the modification and not to pay because if approved the payment of the arrearage would not be necessary. The approval would give me a 2 % interest rate under the HARP program that we were seeking approval for. 
I believed her because when I initially contacted Merrill Lynch I was told that during the processing period for the Loan Modification I that payments did not have to be made and they could be placed back into the balance of the loan. 
I took her advice and did not pay such a big mistake. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a denial letter with demand for payment of all back payments or the loan would go into foreclosure. 
My purpose for seeking the Loan Modification was to reduce my mortgage payments and maintain my home. 
Adhering to the advice of Merrill Lynch 's counselor, XXXX XXXX XXXX, has created a financial hard ship for me. 
Increased Mortgage payment of {$2400.00} monthly not including taxes or insurance. 
Quarterly increases in Mortgage PaymentsInability to pay Utilities TimelyNegative Impact on credit ratingMerrill Lynch would not give me any consideration even though up until this year with my financial hardship and struggle there was never a late payment. 
After the {$5200.00} was paid in XXXX, the balance of the arrearage was added to the future monthly payment. The payments are on time each month however, Merrill Lynch has the audacity to call me to make sure that the payments are made. 
My situation as far as a financial hardship is permanent. I am still retired with a re\\\reduced income. 
There will be no increase in my retirement benefit this year. 
Based on the unfavorable decision from Merrill Lynch and the financial burden and mental anguish that has been placed on me I am seeking your advice for proceeding a Loan Modification under the HARP program.

1735,78608,2015-06-23,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"a ) KeyBank stopped using the existing ACH debit. An ACH payment was in existence, created through Key. Key stopped utilizing the ACH arrangements without any notification in XX/XX/XXXX. The Payor did not terminate the ACH payment. The Payor received no notification that Key would no longer process payments through the existing ACH. Key Bank has not fulfilled it fiduciary responsibility as servicer. 
b ) Key failed to set up a new ACH in a timely manner. When the Key ACH debit was not occurring the Payor went to the branch and discussed this issue with XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Payor was required to provide a cancelled check to set up a new ACH. The Payors expected Key to act in a timely manner so that the ACH debit would be in effect before the next payment was due. Key was negligent in maintaining, establishing, or reestablishing the ACH. 
c ) The Payor made repeated trips to Key 's XXXX Ut. Branch. A minimum of XXXX trips were made to the branch to speak with XXXX XXXX when it was noticed that the monthly ACH Payments were not being drawn. The Payor made payments each time as per the amount that XXXX XXXX stated was owing to bring the account current while waiting for the Key to originate the new ACH. The Payor acted in good faith with the expectation that Key would establish the new ACH payment and its monthly use. These payments have not been applied appropriately. Key 's inactions have harmed the Payor. The actions and inactions of Key have : ( 1 ) harmed the credit of the Payor, ( 2 ) may have caused additional interest and fees to be charged and ( 3 ) may have caused that the incorrect amount was applied towards the principal. 
d ) The Payors have paid the amount/s owing to bring the account current. With the new ACH in place the Payor receives a statement showing that {$180.00} is credited as a payment to the account each month on or about the XXXX day. After receiving the monthly statement from Key, that the ACH payment has been made a notice of a late payment is received. This is ambiguous and confusing. 
e ) The Payor received a call on XX/XX/XXXX. The Caller ID showed XXXX. The caller asked for the Payor 's Social Security Number. Again, the Payor went to speak with the Key Branch XXXX. because of the suspicious nature of this call and asked again regarding the status of the account. XXXX XXXX made a phone call and was put on hold. At the end of the call, XXXX XXXX ONLY gave me amounts of the XX/XX/XXXX payments. I asked if I could get a printout of the account information showing the payments made. XXXX XXXX stated, "" IT WOULD JUST HAVE A LOT OF NUMBERS ON IT THAT YOU WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND ''. XXXX XXXX then said "" I HAVE SPENT XXXX MINUTES WITH YOU - THAT 'S ALL I AM GOING TO DO ''! 
f ) I contacted XXXX XXXX a certified HUD counselor. On XX/XX/XXXX, the Payor and counselor spoke with a representative of Key Bank and asked for account information & clarification to be provided in writing. The Payor stated that the account is disputed, requested copy of original mortgage papers. The Payor had questions if payments we correctly applied. A form cover letter dated XX/XX/XXXX was received on the XXXX of XXXX with a spreadsheet of the account history and no written explanations. The information is not self-explanatory. The letter does not provide a name and phone number for a person to contact. 
g ) Next, the Payor received a call from a KeyBank representative stating that there is a past due amount owing. The Payor stated this issue was being disputed and the Payor had requested information in writing. Now the Payor receives an average of two daily phone calls. The phone rings only XXXX times. The caller ID shows KEYBANK XXXX. When the Payor pick up the phone, the Payor get a dial tone. No one is there. The Payor feels harassed by these calls and has been told that such calls are illegal

They told me that I should not worry about anything, because I could simply make a double payment the next month and everything would be ok.

They sent me the paper work, but everytime I submitted it they returned it to me saying that documents I had already submitted were missing. In the meantime, I was served with foreclosure paperwork. 

When I called Planet Home Lending to inquire about the foreclosure lawsuit, they told me it was nothing to worry about. Planet Home Lending said it was all taken care of for me and that I should not attend court because there would be no foreclosure.

My payments at the time with Indy Mac was {$2500.00} until the agreement was to change XX/XX/XXXX ( adjustable rate based on current interest rate ). OCWEN was suppose to mail me new payment schedule XXXX days prior to XX/XX/XXXX which they did n't. I mailed a mortgage check on XX/XX/XXXX for the normal amount which they received and cashed. I was called a few weeks later from an OCWEN rep inquiring why my payment was n't made? after several min of arguing she admitted they received my check cashed it and was holding it in another account because the amount sent was "" too much ''. The new amount for XX/XX/XXXX was {$1900.00}. I paid this amount for the entire year with NO issues, calls correspondence from OCWEN. prior to XX/XX/XXXX I waited for the supposed "" XXXX day letter '' letting me know what my new payment schedule was because I knew the current interest rate was lower than prior year. The notification never came and I mailed a payment of {$1900.00} as normal and the same issue arose again. Phone call after phone call from different reps asking why my payment was n't made? similar to last time a rep finally admitted they received my check XX/XX/XXXX as normal however it was n't the right amount and they were holding it? per my XXXX Bank the check was cashed. The rep I was speaking to told me my new payment schedule was {$2600.00} which was curious because the interest rate had lowered. I contested this and I was transferred to an escalation manager XXXX XXXX ID # XXXX who took my information and confirmed I was current on my account, no delinquency noted and the previous rep was WRONG with his calculations. He assured me he would research this and would contact me in XXXX business days with a specific time he was calling. He called the very next day and told me "" OCWEN made a mistake, your new rates as of XX/XX/XXXX is {$1.00}, XXXX '' "" The {$1.00}, XXXX being held would be applied to XXXX 's payment obligation and the overage would be applied to principal balance ''. He assured me the phone calls would stop and if they continued to contact him via email : XXXXXXXXXXXX. The harassing phone calls continued relentlessly from OCWEN reps claiming I have n't made my payments and when I explained to them XXXX XXXX the escalation manager took care of your mistake they would not except that as an answer. The would not transfer me to him they would only email him on my behalf to have him call me at which time he has not called me. I emailed XXXX XXXX on dates XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX explaining my situation and asking for help to no avail. I try to call the only number provided however it is answered by a voice mail when prompted to my account states "" they have received my payment of {$1900.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and my new rate is {$1500.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX ''. When prompted to a live person its a call center in XXXX and the reps state the same thing "" this situation was escalated to Manager XXXX XXXX and he is investigating the matter and will get back to you ''. They always transfer to another escalation manager who immediately states I owe them {$2600.00} a month and also agree my new rate is {$1500.00} which is frustrating and confusing. They also agree that my account has never been delinquent and I have never missed a payment however the harassing calls continue. Each new manager assures me they will email XXXX XXXX to call me which he does not. On XX/XX/XXXX I a received certified letter from OCWEN stating I am in default and they are moving to foreclose on my property if I do not respond in XXXX days by phone call ( same XXXX number that goes to an XXXX call center ) or written form. I received a new payment invoice for XXXX payment which now states my new payment is {$1100.00} which now contradicts everything.

I have had trouble paying over the past several years. Due to the bankruptcy I filed in 2009, they are not able to give me pertinent information about my loan unless I specifically define what I am asking. In addition, every time I speak to a CSR, I am given the run-around - from additional numbers, to spouting rules that they can not provide a copy of. This has happened numerous times over the last several years, and more recently in the last 6 weeks. My loan is currently in foreclosure, with {$2200.00} dollars in attorney fees ( when the attorneys have only sent me a letter, and filed for a title search ( which is not even necessary in the state of GA ). When I question the fees, I am told I must pay them to reinstate the loan. Since I can not afford to lose my home, I am between a rock and a hard place. 
When I ask who I need to speak with about the fees, I am referred to a supervisor and no one above that supervisor. When I complain, I get a phone call back from the complaint department which turns out to be a "" I hear you, and I am sorry '' conversation. 
Different CSRs have given conflicting information, and yet, whomever I am talking to at the moment can only reiterate what is in front of them - which does n't help at all. Bank of America has been a thorn in my side since they purchased this loan from Countrywide. I have had payments returned. I have had payments accepted over the phone for a later date, then the payment not processed, because the loan went into foreclosure before the payment date. I have never seen a banking system more designed for the consumer to fail in my life. The level of customer service is deplorable at best.

I have several different student loans based on the years in school and I have XXXX loans being serviced by AES ( American Education Services ). The loan issue that I am complaining about is being serviced by AES. On XXXX/XXXX/15 I went on their website and submitted an ACH payment change request. The notice that was on the change request says the following "" Your existing Direct Debit agreement will be stopped. By submitting a new agreement, we will not debit your monthly installment until the new agreement takes effect. Processing the new agreement may take up to 3 days during which time you will not receive the interest rate reduction ( if applicable ). you may be required to submit payments manually until you receive notification from us stating when the direct debit service will resume. '' After reading that statement I set up a manual payment to ensure my payment would not be late. The ACH payment change request I submitted was for an increase of {$490.00}. Despite the fact that the notice said my existing direct debit agreement will be stopped AES took out my normal direct debit amount and the manual payment ( in essence 2 payments instead of 1 ). After a month I received no written or verbal communication from AES so I called their toll free number and inquired as to why it was taking to long to make a simple payment change and I was informed that "" it had to go to a payment change committee to decide if they will allow me to have my payment increased. '' I was baffled that they would possibly not allow me to pay additional money so that my loan can be paid off sooner. They told me to wait longer and I would receive a letter within a couple weeks. After another month ( now 2 months after the initial request was submitted ) I still had not received any communication from AES so I called their toll free number again and spoke to employee ID XXXX who besides being quite rude said they could n't determine what the problem is with my request. He guessed that I should submit a manual form and mail it in. After I explained I already submitted a form 2 months ago online he said that I should just mail a form in ( despite not providing a form ) and said that the website was broken. I did not want to mail in a form for security reasons as the electronic form is more secure which is why I originally utilized their online account. I asked what he could do to fix the situation and all he said it submit more paperwork and see what happens. I asked to speak to the office of the president and a representative ( employee ID XXXX ) took my information on what I wanted my new payment to be and said he would send it to the ACH department for them to review. The representative said they would try to get back to me within 7-10 days. This issue is still not resolved and it is making me feel as though they wo n't increase my payment which will allow me to pay my loan off sooner since that will decrease the amount of interest they receive on the loan.

Thankfully I graduated, with the help of grants and Federal loans, but I would NEVER use XXXX XXXX again. Nor would I allow any of my family to. The CUSTOMER SERVICE is the absolute WORST. Several times have I called and was spoken to in a disrespectful or condescending, inferior way. I was once told "" well you did n't have to choose to get a student loan through us '' when I had called asking was there any type of way for me to qualify for any loan forgiveness, or debt management programs since I am trying my hardest to make payments and pay down as best possible all by myself as a single mother. Aside from their poor attitudes in customer service their interest rates are too high, they do n't have good forbearance or debt management programs, and the repayments are ridiculous. I wish I never dealt with XXXX XXXX.

They have risen more than 1 % in the past year, with the largest now sitting at more than 12 %. At most, they should have only gone up by .25 % to correspond with the Federal Reserve interest rate hike. In reality, the interest on a loan that ca n't be discharged should never increase. I have never missed a payment, and there has been no change to my income or credit score. I have contacted my servicer twice to inquire as to why they are rising, and have received no response other than "" we have received your communication and will be in touch.
